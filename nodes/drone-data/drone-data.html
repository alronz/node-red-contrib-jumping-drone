   <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This node is used to collect all the data returned by Parrot drone based on the Parrot <a href="http://developer.parrot.com/docs/SDK3">ARDroneSDK3</a>.</p>

<h3>Supported Parrot Drones as of now</h3>

   <ul>
        <li>Parrot Jumping Mini Drones.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Drone Data and Events</h3>
    <p>This node will listen to multiple events triggered by the drone and publish the data to <b>msg.payload</b> object. </p>
    <p>Below are the publish events categorized by drone type: </p>

    <p><b>Jumping Mini Drones:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>'batteryPercentage' - A numeric value indicating the current battery level
    <li>'batteryStatus' - This can be two values based on the events received from the drone as explained below:
    <ul>
    <li>'critical' - Emitted when the battery is at a critically low level.</li>
    <li>'low' - Emitted when the battery is at a low level.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>'status' - The status of the drone which can be <b>ready</b> </li>

    <li>'posture' - The current posture of the drone, this can be 5 values based on the events received from the drone as explained below:
    <ul>
    <li>'standing' - Emitted when the drone changes to the standing posture. The event may be emitted slightly before the movement is complete so you may want to wait a short time before sending the drone further commands.</li>
    <li>'jumper' - Emitted when the drone changes to the jumper posture. The event may be emitted slightly before the movement is complete so you may want to wait a short time before sending the drone further commands.</li>
    <li>'kicker' - Emitted when the drone changes to the kicker posture. The event may be emitted slightly before the movement is complete so you may want to wait a short time before sending the drone further commands.</li>
    <li>'stuck' - Emitted when the drone is stuck.</li>
    <li>'unknown' - Emitted when the drone posture is unknown.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>'jumpLoad' - The jump loading status of the drone, this can be 6 values based on the events received from the drone as explained below:
    <ul>
    <li>'busy' - Emitted when the jump mechanism is busy (for example, if you tell the drone to jump while a jump is already in progress).</li>
    <li>'unloaded' - Emitted when the jump mechanism is unloaded (for example, after a jump or kick). The event may be emitted slightly before the movement is complete so you may want to wait a short time before sending the drone further commands.</li>
    <li>'loaded' - Emitted when the jump mechanism is retracted (for example, after a long jump while in the kicker posture). The event may be emitted slightly before the movement is complete so you may want to wait a short time before sending the drone further commands.</li>
    <li>'unknown' - Emitted when the load state of the jump mechanism is unknown.</li>
    <li>'unloaded and no jump due to battery Low' - Emitted when the jump mechanism is unloaded and the drone cannot perform the jump requested because the battery is low.</li>
    <li>'loaded and no jump due to battery Low' - Emitted when the jump mechanism is unloaded and the drone cannot perform the jump requested because the battery is low.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>'jumpMotor' - The status of the jump motor of the drone, this can be three values based on the events received from the drone as explained below:
    <ul>
    <li>'ok' - Emitted when the jump motor is OK (it may have previously been blocked or overheated).</li>
    <li>'blocked' - Emitted when the jump motor is blocked.</li>
    <li>'overheated' - Emitted when the jump motor has overheated.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>'message' - A message sent from the drone, this can be two values based on the events received from the drone as explained below:
    <ul>
    <li>'image taken and stored internally' - Emitted when a photo is taken and stored internally (response to takePicture(opts)).</li>
    <li>'video frame is (the video frame)' - Emits single MJPEG video frame.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    </ul>
